|  | SecondLife Knowledgebase |  | https://community.secondlife.com/knowledgebase/ |  | The Knowledge Base is a huge resource on all things Second Life.
<br> Many of its articles are available in multiple language
<br> Click the button below and choose the language you are most fluent or confortable with. |  |

|  | Reporting Abuse |  | https://lindenlab.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/31000134592-filing-an-abuse-report |  | If you experience or witness a situation that rises to the level you feel Linden Lab needs to know about (intentional or malicious violations of the Terms of Service, Community Standards, or Bellisseria Covenant) you can file a Abuse Report on the person or object in question. |  |
|  | Blocking a Person or Object |  | https://lindenlab.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/31000136382-blocking |  | Not every interaction with someone is going to be a good one.
<br> So what do you do in that situation?
<br> The most effective method is simply removing yourself from it by Blocking the person.
<br> Find the person or their name, right-click on them, and choose 'Block'
<br> When someone is blocked you cannot see or hear their text, messages, voice or avatar.
<br> You can also block individual objects. |  |
|  | Terms and Conditions |  | https://www.lindenlab.com/legal/second-life-terms-and-conditions |  | Yes, that thing nobody reads and just clicks 'Accept' when they start out.<br> Well, here they are again. :)<br> Click the button below to open the page outlining the Second Life Terms of Service.<br> At the bottom you will find links to other related policies addressing things such as Privacy, Intellectual Property, Gambling, Third Party Viewers, and Age Play. |  |
|  | Maturity Ratings |  | https://community.secondlife.com/knowledgebase/english/maturity-ratings-r52/ |  | The three maturity ratings in Second Life are:
<br> General - Appropriate for all ages
<br> Moderate - Appropriate for most persons over 18
<br> Adult - Content that is sexually explicit, intensely violent, or depicts illicit drug use
<br> These Maturity ratings designate the type of content and behavior allowed in a region and affect search results.
<br> You should always be aware of the rating of the region you are in and act appropriately.
<br> Click the button below for details. |  |
|  | Adult Content |  | https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Linden_Lab_Official:Adult_Content_FAQ |  | What is 'Adult Content'?
<br> That is a very subjective opinion depending on who you ask. Isn't it?
<br> The better question is:
<br> What does Linden Lab consider 'Adult Content'?
<br> Click the naughty button below for Frequently Asked Questions about Linden Lab's official policies on Adult Content. |  |
| , |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | What Next |  | https://secondlife.com/my/whatnext |  | What do you do now? Anything you want really.
<br> Second Life is a world where you don't *have* to do anything... but you can do almost EVERY thing. The only real limits are your imagination and what you want to create or experience.
<br> The options below should help get you started.
<br> Try talking to a Mentor and asking them for some of their favorite things to do. Still feeling a little lost? Try the 'What Next?' button here: |  |
|  | Destinations |  | https://secondlife.com/destinations |  | The Destinations button on your viewer toolbar will always open selected picks from the guide, but the Destinations guide is much bigger than just that.
<br> Would you like to see the FULL guide?
<br> Opening the page in your external web browser and bookmarking it will let you browse places that interest you even when you are not logged in. |  |
|  | Events |  | https://secondlife.com/my/community/events |  | Want to find out what is going on RIGHT NOW?
<br> Try the Events listings.
<br> Events are listed and hosted by residents like yourself.
<br> You can find them under the search button on your viewer, or you can use the button below to open them in your browser. |  |
|  | Groups |  | https://search.secondlife.com/?search_type=standard&places_category=&destinations_category=0&collection_chosen=groups&events_category=0&date=&dateformat=mm%2Fdd%2Fyy&starttime=0000&maturity=gma&query_term=newbie&sort= |  | Groups allow people with a similar interest socialize and coordinate activites.
<br> There are many resident run groups and many of them specifically geared to help new users.
<br> Would you like to open the Second Life Search listings for 'newbie'?
<br>( You will also be able to change the search term to anything else you wish. :) ) |  |
| , |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Movement |  |  |  |     OMG!!! Sooooooo many buttons!!!<br> Touch any of the buttons on this display for a brief explanation of what they do.<br> Then try them on your viewer. <br> Hmm... Maybe don't try the ones on your actual viewer quite yet if they teleport you someplace else...<br> Wow, good thing you can click on the display instead to find out which ones those are, right? |  |
| , |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Ettiquite |  | https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/SLetiquette ? |  | Where do friends come from?<br>Well... when two avatars like each other verrrrrry much one avatar will click on another and select 'Add Friend'. The other avatar will get a message that the person wants to be their friend. If they like them too they can accept, then those two avatars can find each other in their Friends List and will know when each is online.<br> That is how Friends are made. :)<br> Choose MORE below for all the details on Friendship and even how to Partner with someone. |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | Nobody wants to be THAT person.
<br> Awkward social situations happen, both in the real world and the virtual one. To avoid those, it helps to know the ins and outs of interactions in social situations. No one likes to be dismissed as a 'noob' or rude. Knowing and understanding those unofficial rules helps avoid that.
<br> The #1 guideline is (of course): Don't be a jerk.
<br> Click the MORE button to open the Wiki page on 'SLetiquette' (Second Life etiquette) |  |
|  | Roleplay |  | https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Role_play |  |  Some of the people you meet in SL may seem... well... a little weird.
<br> They may talk like they are from another time or another planet like an actor dressed in costume never breaking character. They are possibly engaged in what is called 'Roleplay'.
<br> You don't have to play along, but you can if you choose to.
<br> There are even entire communities devoted to it.
<br> Don't worry, behind all of that they are just as normal as anyone. :)
<br> Click MORE to learn about Roleplay in SL. |  |
|  | Chat |  | https://community.secondlife.com/knowledgebase/english/text-chat-and-instant-messages-r70/ |  | The primary method of communication in Second Life is by text chat via:
<br> Nearby Chat - Can be seen by everyone within 20 meters.
<br> IM (Instant Message) - Can be seen only by the other person.
<br> Group IM - Can be seen by everyone online in the group.
<br> The Chat button at the bottom of your screen will open the Conversations window. Try typing in that window and saying something :)
<br> To IM a person, right-click on them and choose IM.
<br> Click the button below for more details! |  |
|  | Voice |  | https://community.secondlife.com/knowledgebase/english/using-voice-chat-r77/ |  | Let your voice be heard!
<br> Another way of communicating in Second Life is with your voice.
<br> When Voice is enabled your avatar will have a dot overhead. When your microphone is on and you are speaking, green or red waves appear from the dot.
<br> Green = You are speaking normally
<br> Red = Your voice is loud or distorted and needs adjusting.
<br> When using voice we recommend using a headset and to be careful not to leave your mic open.
<br> Click MORE for info on setting up and testing Voice chat. |  |
| , |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Camera Controls |  | https://community.secondlife.com/knowledgebase/english/camera-point-of-view-controls-r16/ |  | Let's see the world!
<br>By using your keyboard and mouse to control the camera, you can view nearly any object or avatar from any angle or distance.
<br>There are several methods, but try PRESSING and HOLDING Ctrl + Alt + Left mouse button to orbit your view around the focal point when you move the mouse in any direction. Use your mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
<br>Escape (ESC) key resets your view to its default location.
<br>Click 'More' for other methods and see which works best for you! |  |
|  | Interacting with Objects |  | https://community.secondlife.com/knowledgebase/english/second-life-quickstart-r373/#Section__4_7 |  | Many objects in Second Life are made to be touched, clicked or sat upon.
<br> This sign is a perfect example.
<br>Let's try another...
<br> Hover your mouse pointer over the benches or chairs here. The pointer turns into a chair icon.
<br> If you click on it your avatar will sit on the chair and bring up a menu like this one for changing your pose.
<br> To stand up again, use the button near the bottom center of your screen labeled 'Stand'.
<br>Now you try! |  |
|  | What is an experence? |  | https://community.secondlife.com/knowledgebase/english/experiences-in-second-life-r1365/ |  | Objects in Second Life will often ask for permission to do things to your avatar, like attaching a cup to your hand or teleporting you someplace. This can happen every time you use the object.
<br> An 'Experience' is just a way to only have to grant those permissions once. 
<br> If you accept the experience, all of this will happen automatically without the permissions request every time.
<br> Click the 'More' button below of all the details on how Experiences work. |  |
| , |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Saving your outfits |  | https://community.secondlife.com/knowledgebase/english/saving-your-avatars-appearance-with-outfits-r1410/ |  |  When you find a look for your avatar you like, or just want to save what you have before making changes, saving it as an outfit is your best friend.
<br> (Sorry, Heather.)
<br> Touch the Outfits icon (it looks like a t-shirt) and look under the My Outfits tab.
<br> There you can save everything you are wearing, make changes, save that as another outfit and switch between the two easy-peasy and more.
<br> Select the MORE button below to find out just HOW much more. |  |
|  | Attaching Items to your Avatar |  | https://community.secondlife.com/knowledgebase/english/avatar-attachments-r8/ |  |  Any object in your inventory can be attached to your avatar and worn as part of an outfit. Hair, jewelry, shoes and other accessories are good. Houses, giant rocks, a tree... not so much.<br> Find the object in your inventory you want to attach and right-click to select Add or Wear.<br> 'Wear' will replace any other object on that attachment point, whereas 'Add' will cause you to wear both. |  |
|  | Changing Your Avatar |  | https://community.secondlife.com/knowledgebase/english/customizing-a-classic-style-avatar-r1377/ |  |  Your avatar looks the way it does based on what items in your Inventory are being worn at any given time.
<br> By attaching/detaching items you can change your look a little or a LOT.
<br> Open your Inventory (the button that looks like a little suitcase) and see what items you are wearing.
<br> Some items you are wearing (like your shape) can be edited to change how you look.
<br> Click the More button below and watch the included video for an in depth tutorial on how to edit your avatar's shape. |  |
|  | Second Life Marketplace shopping |  | https://community.secondlife.com/knowledgebase/english/customizing-a-classic-style-avatar-r1377/ |  |  There are two main ways to buy and sell items in Second Life, either in world from a vendor or online using the Second Life Marketplace.
<br> The 'Shop' icon in the upper-right of your viewer allows for instant access to the Marketplace at all times.
<br> Items purchased will show up in your Inventory's Received Items area.
<br> Choose below if you want more information on Shopping or Selling on the Marketplace. |  |
|  |  |  | https://community.secondlife.com/knowledgebase/english/selling-in-the-marketplace-r88/ |  |  |  |
| , |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Buying and Selling L$ |  | https://community.secondlife.com/knowledgebase/english/buying-and-selling-linden-dollars-r46/ |  |  To buy things in Second Life you need Linden dollars (L$)
<br> Some items are free (0L$) but in general if you want the really good stuff you will need to pay the creator for it.
<br> Click the 'Buy L$' button in the upper right of your viewer's main toolbar to get started.
<br> Or you can select the MORE button below for all the details and a highly informative tutorial video. |  |
| , |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Parcel Media (Web and Video) |  | https://community.secondlife.com/knowledgebase/english/managing-your-parcel-r49/#Section__10 |  |  'Parcel Media' is what we call non-interactive web pages, video, text documents or audio set on the land and displayed on a specific texture on a surface.
<br> This is how most of the videos in this hub work. When you are standing on the parcel you can play the media using the play/pause button in the upper right of the viewer IF media is enabled.
<br> Use the 'More' button to learn how to set media on a parcel. |  |
|  | Parcel Soudn (Musio) |  | https://community.secondlife.com/knowledgebase/english/managing-your-parcel-r49/#Section__10 |  |  'Parcel Music' is related to Parcel Media, except that it is strictly audio only.
<br> This is what is commonly used for musical performances in Second Life.
<br> By setting up an audio stream, residents can play music that is heard in real time by everyone on the parcel.
<br> Use the 'More' button to see how to set up a Music URL on a parcel. |  |
|  | Media on a Prim (Moap) |  | https://community.secondlife.com/knowledgebase/english/shared-media-r65/#Adding_shared_media_to_an_object |  |  Media on a Prim (MOAP) or 'Shared Media' is like parcel media, but is genuinely interactive.
<br> You can use MOAP to display web pages like YouTube videos that a person can play, pause, seek, or even change to another page with browser-like controls.
<br> Rather than changing the url of the parcel media, every surface can have its own media url it points to with an individual connection from your viewer to that media. (i.e. not synced in real time between users) |  |
| , |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | How to Dance (Single) |  |  |  | Dancing in Second Life is done by making your avatar play an animation.
<br> Most dance venues will have an object you click on that asks for permission to animate you. If you allow it, the object will make you dance until you tell it to stop.
<br> It will most likely offer dance choices as well.
<br> Click on the blue dance ball next to this sign and it will give you a typical dance menu (choose 'Single') |  |
|  | How to Dance (Couple) |  |  |  | Dancing together with someone else is slightly different. It normally involves poseballs, objects that animate you when you sit on them.
<br> Click on the blue dance ball next to this sign and open the dance menu.
<br> Choose 'Couples' and two dance balls will appear next to you. Sitting on one will cause you to dance.
<br> Stand up to stop dancing.
<br> Note that you can only choose dances once you have a partner (and no, we will not find one for you) |  |
|  | Dance HUDs |  | https://marketplace.secondlife.com/products/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search%5Bcategory_id%5D=&search%5Bmaturity_level%5D=G&search%5Bkeywords%5D=dance+hud |  | A Dance HUD (Heads Up Display) is an object worn on your screen you take with you wherever you go.
<br> It allows you to always have your favorite dances with you and you can use them anywhere.
<br> Some HUDs will come with preloaded dances. Others will not and require you to add your own. Some even allow you to offer others to do the same dances with you.
<br> Clicking the More button here will open the Marketplace listings for 'Dance HUD' |  |
|  | Group Dancing  |  | https://community.secondlife.com/knowledgebase/english/experiences-in-second-life-r1365/ |  | Some dance venues may even have group dancing.
<br> Click the dance ball next to this sign to try for yourself.
<br> Note that it uses something called an Experience, which asks for more permissions than just animating your avatar.
<br> This is a feature that prevents users from needing to agree to permissions requests every time they use an object.
<br> Click More below to find out more about how Experiences work. |  |
|  | OMG!!! How do I stop Dancing? |  |  |  | OMG!!! I CAN'T STOP DANCING!
<br> When this happens it means something is still animating you.
<br> Normally, using the Stand button at the bottom of your screen or the STOP function on the object animating you will make it stop, but sometimes an animation can get stuck.
<br> If this happens, use Avatar -> Stop Animations or (ALT+SHIFT+A).
<br> Or... just keep dancing... if you really want to and genuinely feel the music in your heart and soul. :) |  |
| , |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Board and Table Games |  | https://marketplace.secondlife.com/products/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search%5Bcategory_id%5D=&search%5Bmaturity_level%5D=G&search%5Bkeywords%5D=board+game |  |  In many games in Second Life you sit at a table to play. Card or dice games are popular.
<br> Some you can play by yourself, but most are designed to be played against another player, making playing such games a nice social activity.
<br> Use the 'More' button below and you will see just how many of these types of games there are. Or you can search for a particular type of game. |  |
|  | Roleplay Games |  | https://search.secondlife.com/?search_type=standard&collection_chosen=places&places_category=&destinations_category=0&collection_chosen=groups&events_category=0&date=&dateformat=mm%2Fdd%2Fyy&starttime=0000&maturity=gma&query_term=gtfo&sort= |  |  Roleplay in itself is a game by which you take on the persona of a character and interact with others in character.
<br> Some games take that even further. One popular game is 'Get the Freight Out' where players take on the role of a cargo hauler and use their own vehicles to transport imaginary cargo from one place to another. The challenge is what provides the innate enjoyment in this type of game.
<br> Click 'More' to open search listings for 'GTFO' |  |
|  | Combat Games |  | https://search.secondlife.com/?search_type=standard&collection_chosen=places&places_category=&destinations_category=0&collection_chosen=groups&events_category=0&date=&dateformat=mm%2Fdd%2Fyy&starttime=0000&maturity=gma&query_term=combat |  |  Combat games have long been a part of Second Life from the beginning.
<br> From 'first person shooter' games to mechanized combat to naval warfare, there are many options if this sort of gaming appeals to you.
<br> Often there are roleplay elements involved in these games depending on he theme.
<br> Click on 'More' to see search listings for 'combat' under places and groups. |  |
|  | Skilled Gaming |  | http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/WelcomeHubSkillGaming/219/128/32 |  |  Skilled Gaming offers you the opportunity to potentially earn Linden Dollars (L$)!
<br> These are resident run establishments where they have games you can play and if you are able to win, the machines can pay you in L$ to your account.
<br> There is even a skilled gaming area here nearby!
<br> Would you like a landmark to the Skilled Gaming area |  |
|  | Gambling vs Skilled Gaming |  | https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Linden_Lab_Official:Policy_Regarding_Wagering_in_Second_Life |  |  It is important to note that gambling is NOT allowed in Second Life, and Skilled Games are NOT gambling.
<br> Gambling would be a game like paying L$ to have a chance at winning L$ based on the random roll of a pair of dice.
<br> Skilled Games could be something like completing a task before time runs out or shooting and hitting an object to earn L$.
<br> Click below for details on Second Life's policies on Gambling and Skilled Gaming |  |
|  |  |  | https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Linden_Lab_Official:Second_Life_Skill_Gaming_Policy |  |  |  |

<br> These use Second Life's physics engine to hit or throw an object at another object.
<br> Popular games like bowling, pool/billiards, archery and golf are but a few.
<br> Click 'More' below to open the search listings for 'golf'. If that is not your game, you can search for whatever that game is. :) |  |
| , |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Permissions |  | https://community.secondlife.com/knowledgebase/english/object-permissions-r57/ |  |  Permission are how YOU decide what the next person who receives an object you create can do with it.
<br> Modify allows them to edit and change the item.
<br> Copy allows them to make as many copies of them as they like.
<br> Transfer allows them to give it to someone else.
<br> If you plan on making and selling your creations for L$ in Second Life it is important you have a detailed working knowledge of how the Permissions system works. |  |
|  | Uploading Assets |  | https://community.secondlife.com/knowledgebase/english/uploading-assets-r75/ |  |  In order for others to see images and animations or to hear sounds you have created, they must first be uploaded to Second Life's servers as an asset.
<br> There is usually a nominal fee in L$ to do this, and they must be in the correct format.
<br> Click 'More' to find out about these in more detail. |  |
|  | Scripting (Lsl) |  | https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSL_Tutorial |  |  'Yes, that is pretty, but what does it DO?!?!'
<br> Many objects have something called 'scripts' inside of them.
<br> A script is essentially a program that tells the object how to behave when interacted with by an avatar or another object.
<br> Scripts are written in Linden Scripting Language (LSL)
<br> Use the 'More' button to browse LSL Scripting Tutorials |  |

|  | Building Tips  |  | https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Good_Building_Practices |  | Anyone can pull a primitive out of their behind, but a good builder learns and knows how to use the tools at their disposal to build practically and efficently.
<br> The Good Building Practices wiki page will help you do just that
<br> it has sections on Mesh, Animations, Physics, Pathfinding, Sounds, Scripting and Textures. |  |
|  | Mesh |  | https://community.secondlife.com/knowledgebase/english/uploading-a-mesh-model-r274/ |  |  Mesh is the term for complex models created using 3D modeling software and then uploaded into Second Life.
<br> Use the 'More' button below to find out how to upload a mesh into Second Life. |  |
|  | Primitives (Prims) |  |  |  |  Primitives (or 'prims') are basic shapes than anyone in Second Life can create at no cost.
<br>
<br> These are the original building blocks of Second Life, literally.
<br> Primitives still have their advantages and uses.
<br> When learning how to create objects and use the Build Tools in Second Life it's usually best to start with learning how to manipulate these primitive shapes.
<br> 'It all starts with a cube.' |  |
